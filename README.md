## DotSub Demo

Manage your albums and photos with ease.

#### Requirements:

-   A user can organize their pictures in multiple albums. Albums are named.

-   Each picture has a creation date, and an optional, editable, custom tag.

-   A single picture or a whole album can be shared with an email address recipient.

-   Users can search pictures by album name, by creation date range, by tag, by the email of the user they've been shared with, or a combination of these filters.

#### Considerations:

-   You can use react-create-app (or Angular CLI) to create the app, along with any quality assurance mechanisms or build tool of choice.

-   There's no need for a back-end, and you can use any sample data as filler. The search/edit/sharing actions don't need to be functioning.

-   The PoC does not need to send out any emails, just allow users to input an email address on pictures/albums they want to share.
